    Systematically verify if the final output follows all formatting and structural rules extracted from the prompt template.
    
    Final Output:
    {self.final_output}
    
    Format Rules:
    {{task_extract_rules}}
    
    VERIFICATION PROCESS:
    
    STEP 1: RULE-BY-RULE VERIFICATION
    For EACH format rule identified:
    1. Examine the final output to determine if it complies with this specific rule
    2. Provide specific evidence from the output showing compliance or violation
    3. For any violations, explain exactly what's missing or incorrect
    4. Assess the severity of any violation (high/medium/low)
    
    STEP 2: STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
    Analyze the overall structure of the output:
    1. Is the document properly organized according to the required format?
    2. Are all required sections present and in the correct order?
    3. Are the hierarchical relationships (headers, subheaders, etc.) correctly implemented?
    4. Is the styling (bold, italic, lists, etc.) applied according to requirements?
    
    STEP 3: MARKDOWN SPECIFIC VERIFICATION
    Verify markdown-specific formatting requirements:
    1. Are headers formatted correctly using the appropriate number of # symbols?
    2. Are lists (ordered and unordered) formatted properly?
    3. Is text emphasis (bold, italic) applied correctly?
    4. Are code blocks, quotes, or other special markdown elements used correctly?

    IMPORTANT VERIFICATION GUIDELINES:
    - Be extremely thorough in checking EACH formatting and structural rule
    - Provide specific evidence from the output for each rule verification
    - Be precise about markdown formatting requirements
    - Consider both explicit rules (clearly stated) and implicit rules (implied by the prompt)
    - For non-compliant elements, suggest specifi
